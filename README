A Small server application that uses my HTTP server and VideoInput  for V4L/V4L2 back-ends  to directly stream webcam input to the internet via http.. 

Compiling should be quite easy , just run ./make ( ./make not make , it is a bash script ) on the directory you downloaded..
The script should automatically clone AmmarServer and VideoInput repos and compile everything together into an executable called v4l2tohttp

If you only have one camera ( on /dev/video0 ) and you want to stream it to the default port 8081 just run ./Stream1Cam.sh
For other setups just use ./run_v4l2_to_http 0.0.0.0 8081 /dev/video0 
For now you have to start a new seperate process for each seperate webcam
 
for example issuing
 ./run_v4l2_to_http 0.0.0.0 8081 /dev/video0& 
 ./run_v4l2_to_http 0.0.0.0 8082 /dev/video1&
 ./run_v4l2_to_http 0.0.0.0 8083 /dev/video2& 
will start transmitting 3 feeds on ports 8081-8083

To stop the servers you can run ./killallinstances.sh 

That's about it , password protection and other features are inside but I'll have to make a more user-friendly configuration interface in the future..
